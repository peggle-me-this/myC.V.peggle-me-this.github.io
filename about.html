    <section>
        <h1 class="about-page">A bit about me,</h1>
        <p id="bio1"> A self-proclaimed food geek, gamer, and nerd, I find joy in all creations in the kitchen and 
            immersing myself in gaming worlds. I have found a new love for programming 
            and I am investigating all I can about the vast domain of coding and technology.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="bio2"> With a passion for education, I've spent years shaping young minds and fostering a love for 
            learning. Drawn to the ever-changing world of technology, I decided to explore coding, seeing 
            it as a way to expand my creative horizons. The shift from the classroom to programming has been 
            an exciting journey, fueled by a desire to understand and actively contribute to the digital realm. 
            I have found joy in the blend of teaching experience and coding skills, not just mastering a 
            new language but developing digital solutions and exploring the endless possibilities of coding. 
            In bridging education and technology, my problem-solving skills acquired through teaching integrate 
            effectively with coding, unlocking creativity, and new diverse opportunities.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="bio3"> Some of my other interests, which I feel strongly about, include personal growth, hiking, and gardening. 
            Dedicating time to my growth and learning is very important to me. Exploring nature and 
            exercising through hiking and cultivating beautiful spaces and food through gardening. I believe 
            a holistic perspective is the overall nourishment of human life. Join me on this journey of 
            exploration and growth, where each day brings new opportunities to learn, create, and inspire. </p>
